This is because smaller chicks will have to fed on the same day that we slaughter our meat broiler.

Most humans prefer to have meat as part of their diet and accordingly an additional processing step have to be included after the fotosynthesis process before the humans can have their food. Important to understand that annimals requires food from plants similar to humans.

Meat adds a of flavour to food, but vegetarians will argue that it is not a requirement in the human diet. Off course vegetarians still consume eggs and milk and thus livestock farming is still required to some extend. Only vegans live on plant based food only and they will argue that they get all the nutrition required for human health.
